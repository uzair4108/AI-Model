Hey there! 
I’m Uzair Sayed, and these are a few of my first steps into the world of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
I’ve always been fascinated by how data can help us make smart predictions — so I decided to try building some small models on my own. Both of these projects were done while I was learning AI through online courses and experimenting on Jupyter Notebook.


 1. Coffee Roast Classifier

This was my very first AI project! I got the idea while reading about how coffee roasting depends on temperature and time.
So I thought — what if a small AI model could tell whether a roast would turn out perfect or not? 

What I did:
Created simulated data for 500 coffee roasts
Used temperature and roasting duration as inputs
Trained a Random Forest model to classify if the roast is “perfect” or not.

Tools I used:
Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn

Result:
The model turned out surprisingly good — it reached around 91% accuracy!
It was simple but gave me a huge confidence boost to build more.

2. Cancer Tumor Classifier

After the coffee project, I wanted to try something that felt a little more meaningful — using AI for health-related predictions.
I used a real dataset from scikit-learn that contains medical measurements of breast tumors.
The goal was to predict whether a tumor is malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous).

What I did:
Used six key tumor features like radius, area, smoothness, etc.
Scaled the data so all values were balanced
Trained a small Neural Network (MLPClassifier)
Tested it on unseen data to check how well it generalizes

Tools I used:
Python, NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn

Result:
The model reached about 90% accuracy, which was really exciting for me — especially because it’s based on real medical data.

 What I Learned
How AI models can find patterns in data that humans might miss
How important data preprocessing and normalization are
The difference between Random Forests and Neural Networks
And most importantly — that even small projects can teach big lessons 

What’s Next
I’m now exploring more advanced topics like:
Deep Learning and Neural Networks
Computer Vision (image-based AI)
Real-world AI projects that can make an impact
